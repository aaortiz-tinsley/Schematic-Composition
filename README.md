# Schematic-Composition
A replica of Sophie Taeuber-Arp's Schematic Composition, 1933 using p5.js

-- The Assignment -- 
The instructions were to produce a mock artpiece using p5.js with a concentration on variables and expressions. I utilized for loops to build and repeat shapes and practiced with a conditional expression to determine the position and color of certain circles. With these statements and basic arithmetic, I found that it can be very simple to make wonderful art with Javascript.
